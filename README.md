Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer! This React app lets you visualize various sorting algorithms in action. I built this app because I was very impressed with similar projects while studying Sorting Algorithms and wanted to build one myself. I have learnt alot about React and Javascript while building this app (which was the primary goal!!). Hope you enjoy playing around with it. Suggestions/feedbacks are welcome!!
